  <dt>Contrast</dt>  
        <dd>I thought Hydroflask's website made good use of contrast throughout their website. Right on the opening page there is constrast between the black header and the various bright colors such as blue, pink, and yellow. </p>
    </dd>
  <br>
  <dt>Repetition</dt>
  <dd>For repetition I used Crumbl Cookies website, more specifically their weekly menu layout. The layout itself is repeitive in the sense that all products follow the same pattern. In addition the fonts are the same for the product name and descirption. </dd>
<br>
    <dt>Alignment</dt>
    <dd>For alignment I found that the Sony Alpha camera website was a very clear example of alignment. They have many differnt topics such as reviews, articles, guides, etc. that are all broken up into sections that have organizational alignment. </dd>
    <br>
    <dt>Proximity</dt>
    <dd>This design element was a little more difficult to tackle persoanlly but a website that I thought followed proximity is Bed Bath and Beyond. With almost all of their sales and promotions right at beginning of the website it almost leads you there. All of the sales and promotions that the company is pushing is an effort to generate revenue, so by keeping these promotions in proximity viewers will be driven there.

  <p>If I had to rank these websites I would personally rank...</p>
